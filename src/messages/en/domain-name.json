      },
      {
        "question": "How to choose the right domain name for my business?",
        "answer": "Opt for a short, memorable, and easy-to-spell name. It should reflect your activity and ideally contain keywords relevant for your local SEO in Marrakech. We advise you to avoid multiple hyphens."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between a .ma and a .com domain?",
        "answer": "The .ma specifically targets the Moroccan market and significantly improves your local referencing in Morocco. The .com is an international extension, ideal if you target a global audience or if you wish to protect your brand internationally."

        "question": "How much does a domain name cost in Marrakech?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How to secure my domain name against cybersquatting?",
        "answer": "We recommend registering the main variations of your domain name (different extensions, common spelling mistakes) and activating the transfer lock. Our service includes proactive monitoring."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if my domain name is already taken?",
        "answer": "If the domain is already registered, we can help you find relevant alternatives or initiate a buyback procedure if it is for sale. We also offer a monitoring service (backorder) to be alerted if it becomes available again."
      },
      {
        "question": "How to transfer a domain name to another provider?",
        "answer": "The transfer requires the EPP code (Auth Code) that we help you obtain, and the unlocking of the domain at the former registrar. Our technical team manages the entire process to guarantee a transition without service interruption."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I have to renew my domain name every year?",
        "answer": "Yes, a domain name is rented for a defined period (generally from 1 to 10 years). We offer automatic renewal to avoid any accidental loss of your web address and your traffic."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I buy a domain name without creating a website immediately?",
        "answer": "Absolutely. You can reserve your domain name to protect your brand and use it later. In the meantime, we can configure a professional waiting page or redirect traffic to your social networks."
